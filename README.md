# TODO-LIST
A To-Do List is a beginner-friendly Python project that helps users add, view, update, and delete tasks. It’s a simple way to organize daily work or reminders while learning about data structures, file handling, and user interaction in Python.
# 📝 To-Do List in Python

## 📖 Overview
This is a **basic command-line To-Do List application** built using **Python**.  
It allows users to **add, view, mark, and delete tasks**, helping them stay organized while learning fundamental Python concepts like lists, loops, conditionals, and file handling.
